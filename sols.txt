2. SQL
a) A database is  the main container which contains all data and log files. 
A schema can be thought of as a way to divide a database into groups of objects based on logical relations between them. In other words, a schema is a blue print of how data is organized in a database (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema). A schema can include several tables and other stuffs of a database such as index, etc.

A table is the basic data storage unit. Data is stored in rows and columns.
A view is the result set of a stored query on the data,  which users of the database can query as a normal Table. This pre-established query command is kept in the database dictionary. 
b) However a view is different from and more advantageous than a table in the following ways:
	+ a view can be a subset of an underlying table. Thus, it helps to limit the exposure the underlying table to outer world. For example,  a given user may be permitted to query the view, while denied access to the rest of the base table.
	+ a view can join and simplify multiple tables into a single virtual table.
	+ views can act as aggregated tables
	+ views take very little space to store since the database contains only the definition of a view, not a copy of all the data that it presents

3)  Bash scripting
The scripts below can be found in files script1.sh and script2.sh in the same folder.

a) script1.sh
#!/bin/bash
HOST='10.11.12.13'
USER='helloFTP'
PASSWD='world' 

ftp $HOST << EOT
user $USER $PASSWD
mget webtrekk_marketing* home/Marketing Report/Data/
cd home/Marketing Report/Scripts/
python ZMR.py
cd home/Marketing Report/Scripts/
psql


To connect to PostgreSQL DB, we can first create a password/config file like .pgpass.conf which contains the line
hostname:port:database:username:password
which in our case should be
10.11.12.13:5439:zalora:helloDB:world

To run script1.sh as a cron job every day at 2.35am create a crontab file with the line:
35 02 * * * bash script1.sh

b) script2.sh
#!/bin/bash
cd /programming-tasks/bash/
find -type f -name 'zalora-*' | xargs rename 's/zalora/Zalora/'
for fname in Zalora-* 
do
cat $fname | tr [a-z] [A-Z] > $fname
cat $fname | sed 's/\.//' > $fname
done;
